## What is this?

Macro/environment definitions and utilities for specific LaTeX packages from CTAN.

Note: basic LaTeX macro/environment definitions come from the `latex2e` package, even though
this is technically not a CTAN "package".

## When should I use this?

If you want information about special functions/macros from particular CTAN packages, or
you need to parse special environments.

## Notes

By default all macros/environments that are exported get processed. If multiple packages
export a macro with the same name, then the later-exported one takes precedence. If two packages
export a macro/environment of the same name but with conflicting argument signatures, this can
cause issues when another unified-latex package processes arguments positionally. For example,
by default `\textbf` takes one argument, but the beamer version of `\textbf` takes two arguments.
During HTML conversion, if arguments are referenced positionally, this may cause previously-working
code to fail with when beamer macro signatures are used. A workaround is provided: `_renderInfo.namedArguments`.
If `_renderInfo.namedArguments` is specified on both the original macro/environment definition
**and** the conflicting one, other unified-latex commands can reference arguments by name instead
of by position.

## Install

```bash
npm install @vizex_ru/unified-latex-ctan
```

This package contains both esm and commonjs exports. To explicitly access the esm export,
import the `.js` file. To explicitly access the commonjs export, import the `.cjs` file.
